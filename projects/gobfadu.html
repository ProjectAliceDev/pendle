                    <h3>Built with Applet Security in Mind</h3>
                    Applets make up the app ecosystem for AliceOS. Applets are how third-party developers add additional functionality to AliceOS and interact with users and players. For Applet Security, the GOBFADU Policy checks for any modification that is unauthorized and instantly blocks the Applet from running on the OS, prompting you to reinstall the Applet entirely.
